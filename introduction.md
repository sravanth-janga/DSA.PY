# Introduction

​

A Graph is one of the most useful and interesting data structures. We can model many complex problems as graphs and apply the desired algorithm on that model to get the final result.

`Some of the real world problems are shortest distance between two cities, optimal road plan to connect a group of cities etc.`

A typical simple graph with four nodes or \(vertices\) with some edges between them can be visualized like this. For now don't worry about the look and meaning of each of the component in this graph. We'll go through some important terminology useful in graph theory in the next section.
